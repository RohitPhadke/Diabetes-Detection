# Diabetes-Detection-Using-KNearest-Neighbors
The aim of this project is to detect Diabetes in a person using various parameters like 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'BMI', 'Insulin'. We predict whether a person has diabetes using K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
We use the diabetes dataset from kaggle which consists of 786 rows.
