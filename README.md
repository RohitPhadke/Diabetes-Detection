# Diabetes-Detection-Using-KNearest-Neighbors
The aim of this project is to detect Diabetes in a person using various parameters like 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'BMI', 'Insulin'. We predict whether a person has diabetes using K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms.
We found out that both Random forest algorithm and XGBoost algorithm had same accuracy.
Thus we can use any of the algorithm between them.
We use the diabetes dataset from kaggle which consists of 786 rows.
